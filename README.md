#### *"Built on curiosity. Powered by code."*

I'm a Data Scientist & Machine Learning Engineer with 4+ years of experience, passionate about solving real-world problems using data.

My core interests lie in Machine Learning, NLP, and the evolving landscape of Large Language Models: Agentic AIâ€”designing systems that can reason, plan, and act autonomously.

I also work as a freelancer on [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01dbfe140dd4d24bea)
